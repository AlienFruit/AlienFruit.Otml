**OTML** is an object tree model language.
It is a language that describes a tree of objects, which is easily readable by both man and machine. 
It is abstract, flexible and simple, there is no data standardization and no arrays in it. OTML supports comments and stream processing.

## OTML targets
 - To be easily understandable to a man
 - To be minimalistic: have a syntax consisting of a minimum set of rules
 - To be as abstract and flexible as possible, allowing to describe as many different data structures as possible
 - To support data stream processing
 - To develop and change easily, have a version system
 - Forget about it: `{}`, this: `[]` and this: `()`
